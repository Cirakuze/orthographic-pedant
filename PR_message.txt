@{user_name}, I've corrected a typographical error in the documentation of the 
[{repo_name}](https://github.com/{user_name}/{repo_name})
project. You should be able to merge this pull request automatically. 
However, if this was intentional or if you enjoy living in 
linguistic squalor, please let me know and 
[create an issue](https://github.com/thoppe/orthographic-pedant/issues/new)
on my home repository.
