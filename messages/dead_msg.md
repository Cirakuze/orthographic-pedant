> I'm writing on behalf of GitHub support because we've received reports that one of your projects may be opening automated pull requests on other users' projects. Many users consider it spam when a bot posts a pull request to their account unless they have specifically opted in to be a part of that project, and this activity is against our Terms of Service. My suggestion is to make your bot completely opt-in to keep up the goodwill of the community.

> If we receive further reports of spammy activity, we may need to disable the repository or account.

> Hello Jack! I've been waiting for this email for sometime now.

> I'd love to finish the project, but at your request it will be shutdown. If I may, I'd like to share the final stats on this week-long endeavor. The pull requests were semi-automated -- all of the requests were verified by me before sending out and all PR's that were sent recieved a response by a human. That said, it's not up to me to allow this project to continue and no _new_ PR's will be sent out.

> I submitted about 2700 PR with over 2000 of them merged successfully merged (many of them just haven't responded yet). Of the people that responded 95% were extremely positive and thanking either me or @orthographic-pedant for the correction. The other 5% vehemently disliked the correction and I'm sure this is where the reports came from. I'm merged or informed PR's on a bunch of big names including Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, AWS, Cloud Foundry, heroku, Flipboard eBay and Elastic Search.

> As I mentioned in my original message, projects like this are welcome as long as the folks on the receiving end of those PRs have opted in to participate. It is the unsolicited nature of the automated contact that is a concern. It sounds like you have generated some excitement amongst folks who'd be happy to continue receiving those PRs, but please limit this activity to projects that have explicitly consented.
